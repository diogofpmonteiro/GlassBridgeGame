-- TODO : 
    - numOfLives feature
    - paneBreak feature (delete glass panes that you already passed, with sound and animation - at the end)
    - gameover feature 
    - movePlayer method - IMPORTANT
    - full bridge spawning - IMPORTANT


- In progress but broken: 
    - movePlayer method (make player go to whatever pane you select with arrow keys, maybe animations as well? (falling - scream sound?) - at the end)
    - full bridge spawning (needs work on the loop. only first iteration works)
