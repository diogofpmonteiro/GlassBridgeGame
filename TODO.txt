    - add animations to movePlayer
    - delay some animations 
    
- In progress but not ready: 
    - new level
    - highest score feature

- DONE: 
    - Score function is done BUT will not be implemented until new levels are.

BUGS THAT NEED FIXING: 

when you press another button before jumping, it registers and will jump over a row
when you press multiple buttons it will crash the jumping function
